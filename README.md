WARNING: Obsolete now. Superseded by https://github.com/comptf2c/comptf2c

Sourcemod plugins for use with a Team Fortress 2 Classic server, for use with tournament mode and class limits.

Ready Up:
Allows non-spectators to set their ready status to begin a match. Once all players execute sm_ready or type "/ready", the waiting for players phase will be skipped and the game will begin.
Set mp_tournament 1 to get use out of this.

Comp Civ:
For use on VIP and VIPR gamemodes, this plugin allows players to become the VIP simply by setting their class to civilian. On a team that is not escorting, players selecting civilian will be set to spectate their team.
Set tf2c_vip_autoassign 0 and tf2c_vip_switchteams 1
